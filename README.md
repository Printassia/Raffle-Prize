# Raffle Prize

You have three identical prizes to give away and a pool of 30 finalists. The finalists
are assigned numbers from 1 to 30. Write a program to randomly select the numbers of three finalists to receive a prize. Make sure not to pick the same number
twice. For example, picking finalists 3, 15, 29 would be valid but picking 3, 3, 31
would be invalid because finalist number 3 is listed twice and 31 is not a valid
finalist number.
